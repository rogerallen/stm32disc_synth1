# STM32F407VG Discovery Synth

Simple wavetable synthesizer for intro to audio on this kit using STM32CubeIDE.
I'm learning as I go.  Maybe this can also be useful for others.

## Goals

- wavetable synth
- use user button to switch between 4 notes
- 4 notes displayed on LED  

## Steps

- create new project in STM32CubeIDE
- select STM32F407VG-DISC1 board as starting point
- said "no" to initializing board connections to the default setup.
- create git repo to track
- add generated files
